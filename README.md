This repository aims to highlight some of the projects that I've done thorughout my studying and free time. 
Data science and a sprinkle of machine leanring here and there to support the analysis. 

Will continue to add more here as I find more interesting datasets to play with.

# List of Projects:
  - ## Rainbow Six Siege S5 Ranked Analysis üî´:
    - This anlaysis highlights the different factors that affect gameplay backk in rank season 5 of R6.
    - Sprinkling of Machine learning (Prediction using Linear Regression).
    - Player expression is a key important feature the game adds as to keep matches interesting and a bit tailored to the player. However, operator choice tend to be more consistent, with Frost and Rook to be the top operators played during the time garnered consistent wins. 
    - *Apologies for the zip file as the analysis for this was very extensive, I went a little trigger happy with dash apps. 

  - ## Online News Popularity Anlaysis üé∂üëó:
    - This file covers more on how online news becomes popular or goes viral, going deeper to the business side and focusing more on business analytics.
    - Key words in an online news article led to its popularity, with the addition of posting during the weekend garner the most shares, averaging more than 2000 per day. 
    - Utilised RFM Analysis, Market Basket (aPriori), and a LOT of time series graphs.

  - ## Nata Supermarket Analysis üíµ:
    - The analysis highlights customer demographics for the business, with the addition of market basket analysis for each type of buyer.
    - A sprinkle of machine learning (ARIMA and Prophet), just testing out if its possible to use this even with little data.
    - Results show the steady decline of the business as predictions and time series graphs present a clear decline of interest from customers to buy. Advice for the business is to switch to newer methods as it is made clear that they still follow a manual approach in handling there data. A good start would be adjusting their use on data, turning to a more digital data collection rather than a ledger (as noted by the owner of the business * note this is just the scenario given)
    - The dataset came from a professor of mine and I have permission to add this here (ehe).
   
  - ## Win Anlaysis + Web Scraping Analysis üç∑:
    - A simple classification machine learning problem for the first dataset containing components of each wine bottle. The use of webscraping combined with classification machine learning enables the identification of wine types.
    - I do remmeber accurately determining the wine types here but I can't seem to find the comment for it, gomen.
   
  - ## Online Retail EDA üëö:
    - Given how extensive the dataset is, I went a bit deeper with providing business and sales analytics than a simple EDA.
    - The store is thriving with most of its customer base are repeat customers, with these customers mostly focusing on purchasing light-based home decor (Tea lights, lamps, etc.)
    - RFM method reveals that most of the customers for this store are loyal and great buyers, however, it is greatly adviced to take care of these customers as most of them tend to not commit to the store.
