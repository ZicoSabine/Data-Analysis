This repository aims to highlight some of the projects that I've done thorughout my studying and free time. 
Data science and a sprinkle of machine leanring here and there to support the analysis. 

Will continue to add more here as I find more interesting datasets to play with.

# List of Projects:
  - ## Rainbow Six Siege S5 Ranked Analysis üî´:
    - This anlaysis highlights the different factors that affect gameplay backk in rank season 5 of R6.
    - Sprinkling of Machine learning (Prediction using Linear Regression).
    - Player expression is a key important feature the game adds as to keep matches interesting and a bit tailored to the player. However, operator choice tend to be more consistent, with Frost and Rook to be the top operators played during the time garnered consistent wins. 
    - *Apologies for the zip file as the analysis for this was very extensive, I went a little trigger happy with dash apps. 

  - ## Online News Popularity Anlaysis üé∂üëó:
    - This file covers more on how online news becomes popular or goes viral, going deeper to the business side and focusing more on business analytics.
    - Key words in an online news article led to its popularity, with the addition of posting during the weekend garner the most shares, averaging more than 2000 per day. 
    - Utilised RFM Analysis, Market Basket (aPriori), and a LOT of time series graphs.

  - ## Nata Supermarket Analysis üíµ:
    - The analysis highlights customer demographics for the business, with the addition of market basket analysis for each type of buyer.
    - A sprinkle of machine learning (ARIMA and Prophet), just testing out if its possible to use this even with little data.
    - Results show the steady decline of the business as predictions and time series graphs present a clear decline of interest from customers to buy. Advice for the business is to switch to newer methods as it is made clear that they still follow a manual approach in handling there data. A good start would be adjusting their use on data, turning to a more digital data collection rather than a ledger (as noted by the owner of the business * note this is just the scenario given)
    - The dataset came from a professor of mine and I have permission to add this here (ehe).
   
  - ## Win Anlaysis + Web Scraping Analysis üç∑:
    - A simple classification machine learning problem for the first dataset containing
